**Tama Habits** is a habit tracker attached to a tamagotchi-style virtual pet. A demo of this app was first developed as my capstone project at the Ada Developers Academy. It is currently in development using **Flutter** for **Android**, **iOS**, and the **web**.

The app allows you to keep a list of habits and track their completion over time.

When habits are incomplete, the pet gets hungry and sick. Completing habits feeds the pet and makes it happier.

Part of **One Thousand Machines v1.1**. Excerpted [from abbymachines.art](https://abbymachines.art/A/OneThousandMachines_v1-1/): *2022.5.2. This one is in lieu of my April report. I thought this time I would just embed wormchat (v1), my first attempt at an interactive chatbot. Building this has taught me a bit more about Markov chains, though I am still trying to wrap my head around them.
